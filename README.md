# Pynuke: Discord Server Nuker

Pynuke is a **Discord bot** designed for maximum chaos, capable of **nuking** a server with a combination of actions like **flooding channels, sending massive DMs,** and **changing server details**. If you're looking to disrupt a Discord server, Pynuke is the tool for the job.

## Features

- **Channel Creation**: The bot creates up to **100 random channels** with chaotic names. Each channel will be filled with **200 random messages** to ensure maximum disruption.

- **DM Spam**: The bot sends **500 direct messages per user** with randomly selected spam messages, ensuring no one is left untouched.

- **Server Identity Change**: Pynuke can change the **server name** to "FAT RATTER SERVER" and the **server icon** to a custom image, altering the server's identity.

- **Random Role Assignment**: The bot randomly assigns **roles** to all members in the server, causing confusion and disorganization.

- **Custom Messages & Random Ping**: The bot can send custom spam messages to every channel, with random pings like `@everyone` and `@here` to stir more chaos.
