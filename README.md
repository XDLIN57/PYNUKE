# 🔥 Pynuke - Discord Server Nuke Bot 🔥

Pynuke is a **powerful Discord bot** designed for **total server disruption**. It has the capability to create multiple channels, flood them with spam, change the server’s identity, and perform a variety of chaotic actions—all at once.

---

## ⚡ Features

- **Create 100 Channels**: Pynuke can create **100 random text channels** with disruptive and offensive names to cause chaos across your server. Each channel will be used to spread confusion and disorder.
  
- **Flood Channels with Spam**: Every channel created by Pynuke will receive **200 random messages**, which can include anything from random text to commands or pings. This ensures maximum disruption and irritation for everyone involved.

- **DM Spam**: The bot will send **500 DMs to each member**, using random spam messages, making sure no one is left untouched.

- **Server Name & Icon Change**: Pynuke will change the **server's name** to "**FAT RATTER SERVER**" and **update the server icon** to a custom image, further altering the identity of the server.

- **Random Role Assignment**: Pynuke randomly assigns **roles** to all members of the server, ensuring a confusing and chaotic experience for the server's members.

---

## 🚨 How It Works

- **Server ID**: The script will prompt for the **server ID** of the server you want to nuke.
  
- **Spam Messages**: You provide a list of **spam messages** that will be used in the flooded channels and DMs.

- **Server Image**: Drop your custom **server image** (such as a logo or random image) into the `image` folder, and the bot will use it to change the server's icon.
