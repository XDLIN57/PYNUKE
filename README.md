# Pynuke - Discord Server Nuker Bot

**Pynuke** is a powerful, customizable Discord server nuking bot designed to cause chaos in a Discord server. With features like mass DM spamming, channel creation, message spamming, and more, it’s a destructive tool that automates various actions in Discord servers. The bot works by targeting a specific server ID, and it executes a series of events to disrupt the server in multiple ways.

## Features

### 1. **Mass DM Spamming**
   - The bot can send up to **50 direct messages per user** in a targeted server.
   - You can configure custom messages to be sent in cycles to every member (excluding the bot itself).
   - This feature can be run indefinitely, causing constant DM spam to members of the server.

### 2. **Server Configuration**
   - The bot changes the server's name and icon to a custom image you specify.
   - Allows the setting of custom messages for channels and users, including the ability to configure the content for spam.

### 3. **Channel Creation & Spamming**
   - The bot creates **69 random channels** in the server (this number can be modified).
   - Each channel will receive **100 messages**, which are selected randomly from a predefined list.
   - Certain channels may also trigger @everyone or @here pings to cause further disruption.

### 4. **Role Creation & Management**
   - Custom roles can be created for additional chaos, which you can set in the bot configuration.
   - Allows dynamic role assignments and edits, which can cause confusion among server members.

### 5. **Customizable Messages and Channel Names**
   - You can define custom spam messages that will be sent across the channels.
   - You can also define custom channel names to further personalize the chaos you want to create.

### 6. **No Event Creation (Removed)**
   - The bot no longer creates scheduled events, focusing only on server disruption like mass channel creation and DM spamming.

### 7. **Rate Limiting Handled Gracefully**
   - The bot includes logic to handle Discord's rate limits gracefully, attempting to retry after being rate-limited.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pynuke.git
   cd Pynuke
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional, recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Ensure that `discord.py` and `colorama` libraries are installed**:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py colorama
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   After setting up your bot token, the script will run. Make sure you have your bot token ready.

2. **Configure Settings**:
   When prompted, enter the following:
   - Bot token
   - Server ID (the ID of the server you wish to nuke)
   - Custom messages (spam messages for DMs and channels)
   - Custom channel names (the names for the channels that will be created)
   - Custom role names (roles to be assigned)
   - Custom server image (place the image in the `image` folder)

3. **Start the Nuke**:
   The bot will initiate the nuking process, starting with mass DM spamming, followed by channel creation, message spamming, and role management.

### Example Run
```bash
Enter your first bot token: <bot_token>
Enter the server ID to nuke: <server_id>
Enter custom message 1: Hello
Enter custom message 2: NUKE
Enter custom message 3: meheheh
Enter custom message 4: ADIOS
Enter custom channel names: spam-channel, chaos-room, general-chat
Enter custom role names: raider, admin, helper
```

Once the setup is done, the bot will execute the `nuke_server` function and start spamming and destroying the server.

## Notes

- **Permissions**: Make sure the bot has administrative privileges in the server you're nuking. It requires the ability to send DMs, delete channels, and create new channels.
- **Rate Limits**: Discord's API has rate limits that might cause the bot to pause temporarily. The script handles rate limiting gracefully by waiting before retrying.
- **Legal Warning**: This script is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this tool on servers without permission**. Nuking servers without consent may violate Discord's Terms of Service, resulting in permanent bans.
