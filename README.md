### 1. **Blue Text (Links or Code Highlighting)**:
   - In Markdown, text that looks blue could be a link or inline code. For example:
     - `https://github.com/yourusername/Pynuke.git` → This will appear as a clickable blue link.
     - `python -m venv venv` → This could be displayed as inline code in a different font.

   To prevent confusion, ensure that any URL or code block is formatted properly:
   - **For links**: Make sure links are properly formatted like this:
     ```markdown
     [Text here](http://link.com)
     ```
   - **For code**: Enclose your code in backticks:
     - Inline code: `python -m venv venv`
     - Block code:
       ```bash
       python -m venv venv
       ```

### 2. **Unexpected Words (like "axetrix")**:
   If you're seeing random words like "axetrix" that you didn't write, this could be a result of:
   - **Autocorrect issues**: Sometimes text gets misinterpreted or auto-corrected if you copied/pasted from a different source.
   - **Hidden characters**: If you've copied the README from a different text editor or source, there might be invisible characters causing rendering problems.

### Solution to Fix:

- **Clean Up the Markdown**: Double-check and ensure all syntax is correct and doesn't have any hidden formatting.
- **Use Raw Text Editors**: Open the README in a raw text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or VS Code) to make sure there are no strange characters or extra formatting.
